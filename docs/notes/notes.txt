Purpose: Use TDD methodology from start to finish on a project.
Project Idea: build a perl scirpt that will convert a picture into a plan for building a 2D lego picture.

Requirements:
----
Perl
Test::More
TDD
ImageMagick


A command-line way to pixelate an image
---
convert -scale 10% -scale 1000% avatar_cropped.jpg avatar_cropped_pixelated.jpg

Image::Magick on CPAN
---
cpan -i Image::Magick

LEGO BRICK DIMENSIONS
---
There are five basic dimensions:
The horizontal pitch, or distance between knobs:  8mm.
The vertical pitch, or height of a classic brick:  9.6mm.
The horizontal tolerance:  0.1mm
This is half the gap between bricks in the horizontal plane.  The horizontal tolerance prevents friction between bricks during building.
The knob diameter:  4.8mm
This is also the diameter of axles and holes.  Actually a knob must be slightly larger and an axle slightly smaller (4.85 and 4.75 respectively, otherwise axles would not turn in bearing holes and knobs would not stick in them) but we will ignore this difference here.
The height of a knob:  1.8mm

TDD
---
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new one fails
3. Write some code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code and Document
Repeat
